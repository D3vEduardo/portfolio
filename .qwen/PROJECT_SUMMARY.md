# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a smooth transition effect where the Loading component fades out with a blur effect when the PortfolioLayout is rendered, creating a polished loading experience for the portfolio application.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology stack: Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling
- Animation library: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for complex animations
- Loading component file: `app/[[...allPaths]]/_loading.tsx`
- Main page file: `app/[[...allPaths]]/page.tsx`
- The transition needs to smoothly fade out and blur the loading screen before showing the portfolio layout

## Recent Actions
- Modified the Loading component to accept an `isFinished` prop and added CSS transitions for fade-out and blur effects
- Updated the Portfolio page to manage transition state with two phases: first trigger the transition effect, then remove the loading component after the animation completes
- Implemented CSS transitions using Tailwind classes (`transition-all duration-1000 ease-in-out` along with `opacity-0 blur-md` for the finished state)
- The loading screen now waits for a random duration (3500-5000ms) before starting the transition

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Modify the Loading component to include a fade-out animation
2. [DONE] Add CSS styles for the blur and fade-out transition
3. [DONE] Update the Portfolio component to manage the transition state
4. [TODO] Test the smooth transition between Loading and PortfolioLayout - needs development server to verify the effect
